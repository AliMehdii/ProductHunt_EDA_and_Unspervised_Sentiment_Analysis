The whole process was painful: it took a lot of time to find the right streamers, negotiate terms, make prepayments, etc. Ultimately, the streamer could just walk away from the deal. Worst of all, the results were unpredictable. It was clear that the model was flawed and mainly benefited the top streamers🤦\\u200d♂\\n\\nThat’s why we launched Drope.me - to help companies pay only for measurable results in influencer marketing campaigns. Now with as little as $200, a company can launch a campaign with 100's of micro-streamers in less than 10 minutes! This saves time and money while also allowing micro streamers to earn revenue and collaborate with exciting gaming companies they may not have had access to before.\\n\\nDrope.me is the go-to influencer marketing platform, connecting gaming brands and over 17,000 Twitch micro-streamers. Our platform empowers gaming companies to run performance-driven campaigns and helps streamers monetize their passion through collaborations with top gaming brands💥\\n\\nTo celebrate our Product Hunt launch, we have a special offer for the community💣 The first 20 hunters who launch their campaigns on Drope.me to engage micro streamers will get a 100% discount on our commission via promo code PHDROPEME. \\n\\nMany thanks to our fantastic team, who made this launch possible: @anna_miz , @tatiana_stronskaya , @friede1 , @ivaaaan , @quarta_ , @ventil , @stepovyia  , @yevhenii_mostipan\\n\\nLet's chat in the comments below.

Not a Martin Luther King \"I have a dream\" dream, but a regular ol\\' snoozing dream, in which I built a website called \"Chore Pig\". When I woke in the middle of the night, I couldn\\'t quite remember what the app was supposed to do, but I frantically pulled up a domain search engine, and ended up the proud owner of <a href=\"https://chorepig.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://chorepig.com</a>.\\n\\nI have a complicated relationship with to-do lists. Though I undoubtedly am better at juggling tasks and remembering what needs doing when I use a list, I also find that the design of many apps goads me into focusing on the process of checking items off the list rather than the substance of the list itself. Is this a priority 3 or a priority 4 task? What other task can I check off to hit my daily streak? This list is so messy - do I need more tags, more sections, more projects??\\n\\nI\\'m not sure how widespread these feelings are, but given that one of the leading to-do apps has a \"Vacation mode\" which will retain your daily streak while you\\'re away, I don\\'t think I\\'m the only one. I want an app that helps me remember what to do, not one that pushes me into becoming a pig. A real chore pig.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s already tons of apps out there that would work for me. So why build a new one? My phone\\'s notes app would work, but syncing across devices is a bit tricky. There\\'s about 4,213 Google task apps, but you never know if the one you choose is going to be shut down tomorrow. For a while I even sent myself emails with tasks, but... blech!\\n\\nErgo, Chore Pig. So what does it do?\\n\\nChore Pig is a website, but the data is stored locally on your device. No sign-up is required, just go to the site and start adding tasks to the hog log.\\n\\nChore Pig is also a Progressive Web App (PWA), making it installable on your phone or tablet for easy access. Navigate to the website using Chrome on Android or Safari on iOS, and within too long you should get a prompt to install Chore Pig as an application.\\n\\nChore Pig is offline-first, meaning that you can keep on adding and completing tasks, even when your network is spotty, or non-existent.\\n\\nIf you want to take your porcine commitment to the next level, you can sign up for an account for a one-time fee of $10. Sign in to the account on any device that you want to sync tasks between, and Chore Pig will automatically back up your tasks whenever you have an internet connection.\\n\\nBy creating an account, you\\'d also be giving me $10, which makes you just bully in my book. In turn, I will funnel around $5 of that straight to some hogs. And other animals, too – I will donate 50% of the profits from Chore Pig to The Humane League.

Maik here, excited to launch for the first time on Product Hunt! 🚀\\n\\nI'm not here to just pitch a project; I'm here to share my story and invite you along for the ride.\\n\\nWhen I was a teenager, I discovered a new world: the internet. I fell in love with a game called Runescape, where I could complete quests, meet people, and build up my in-game skills - I even maxed out many of them 😄. One skill that particularly caught my attention was the construction skill. It let me create a virtual home and invite friends over, which was really cool.\\n\\n🕹️ The internet became my second home, a place where I felt safer than in the real world. It's where I learned English and made friends from all over the globe; it was my first close experience with some form of a metaverse. If you've read the book or watched the movie Ready-Player-One, then you might relate to what I am talking about. If not, you should definitely do it! \\n\\nThis virtual life sparked an interest in me for digital design and architecture, so much so that I ended up getting a degree in architecture, and I now work as a product designer for a web3 startup.\\n\\nLast year, I wanted to do more than just dream about the metaverse. I wanted to build on it, to be part of the future. But when I started to research, I hit a wall.\\n\\n❓There wasn't a lot of info out there, and the existing communities were pretty hard to find. Plus, no one was (or is) really talking about metaverse designers.\\n\\n🏠 Despite these obstacles, I managed to launch a metaverse project on Spatial and Decentraland. As an architect and a gamer, this experience was so much fun! It reminded me of my teenage years when I did things purely for the joy of it.\\n\\n🌐 Fast forward to 2023, and I still couldn't find a platform that was mainly focused on metaverse creators. So, over a weekend, just for fun, I decided to create one myself.\\n\\nI call it metahub, a combination of 'metaverse' and 'hub'. I know it's not the most original name, but it gets the job done, and 'meta' was already taken, heh.\\n\\n💡 The idea is simple: To help metaverse designers get noticed and help others learn how to design for the metaverse.\\n\\nBeing a metaverse designer isn't just about building houses in a decentralized virtual world. It's far broader than that! You could be a Roblox designer, a fashion designer, a designer of vTuber avatars, a VR artist building digital experiences - the list goes on!\\n\\nSome people write off the metaverse as a trend that's already passed, but I see it as the next step for the internet. \\nMy hope is that Metahub can help discover new talent and even assist many in becoming a part of this emerging and exciting field.\\n\\n➡️ So if you're curious or want to get involved with the metaverse community, all you have to do is visit the site and click 'Join'! or DM me, that also works :) .\\n\\nI can't wait to meet the amazing metaverse designers out there, and those yet to come!\\n\\n- Maik\", 'votesCount': 2}}, {'node': {'body': 'Hello @maikwithm  congrats on launching such a cool product.

You can also customize WizeBot\\'s appearance, greeting message, and fallback responses to align with your brand.\\n\\n💡 Key Features\\nWith WizeBot, you can:\\n* Create a chatbot tailored to your business needs\\n* Upload documents to your bot’s knowledge base\\n* Customize the chatbot\\'s appearance and responses\\n* Integrate WizeBot into your website or knowledge base easily\\n* Monitor and improve WizeBot\\'s performance through analytics\\n\\n💰 Pricing\\nTo get started, WizeBot offers a free plan that provides access to essential features.

We think that customer trust is essential to any business, hence if our systems are unsure of a correct response, it won\\'t attempt to \"hallucinate\" information. This is in contrast to many other services, which will try to extrapolate the right answer, even if it isn\\'t true. However, we still need to acknowledge that not every AI system is perfect, and we are constantly working towards this issue.\\n\\nSecondly, we provide customers the ability to send business\\'s a message if the chatbot is unsure. This way, WizeBot can fully replace a traditional help desk system. For questions WizeBot can answer, WizeBot will happily answer. For the questions WizeBot can not answer, the user will be prompted to send a message to the bot owner.\\n\\nThirdly, we allow the ability to password protect your chatbot. This way, you can limit a chatbot to internal or specific customer use. For enterprise solutions such as SSO, feel free to contact us.\\n\\nWe think WizeBot can be used in more than just customer service. For example, firms can deliver projects with an attached chatbot, providing clients with better service. Onboarding guides can be switched over to onboarding chat bots to help new users. And so many more!\\n\\nOnce again, we would love to help any new users onboard to WizeBot. Send us an email at: (<a href=\"mailto:support@wizebot.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">support@wizebot.io</a>) or reach out on other social medias.

We noticed an increasing demand for tools that can either replace or simplify the work of developers - low-code/no-code technologies. With predictions indicating that by 2030, over 60% of mobile and web applications will be built using these technologies, we decided to step in. Codejet fully automates the conversion of design into functioning code, saving around 60% of the front-end developers\\' time.\\n\\nImagine this - in the fourth quarter of 2022, there were 507,690 UI designers worldwide and about 17.2 million front-end developers who convert these designs into functional code. Each element of an application is manually processed. With Codejet, we can save up to 60% of the time that a programmer would spend on this kind of work. That\\'s a significant saving for a company creating or outsourcing an application!\\n\\nOur primary customers are software agencies employing 2-10 front-end developers and freelancers. We aim to solve their pain points such as:\\n👉 Project costs rising due to improperly implemented frontend by developers.\\n👉 Multiple front-end corrections leading to logic errors.\\n👉 Time-consuming processes during front-end implementation, such as forms.\\n👉 Late changes to the UI project, which can be costly and error-prone.\\n\\nCodejet is a dev tool, not just a code converter for landing pages. The elements we generate can be edited and reused elsewhere. \\n\\nIf you have your own Figma, it will require a few tweaks, but they won\\'t take more than a few hours - here are the instructions.

The apps that have traditionally served this purpose well have taken a hard pivot toward entertainment content created by people you don't know, and even though this content is entertaining, it also crowds out the other content that friends share with each other. So now we're left sorting through a ton of message threads to see what's going on with friends, or most commonly, we just don't get that update at all. That's a superpower lost.\\n\\n@ryanolsonk and I first worked together on the project that became Instagram Stories, where we fell in love with this use case of opening a window into friends' lives. We were recently joined by @petermcottle and @seanleach_, who also share IG DNA and a love for craft and simplicity. Even though consumer social is insanely hard, we decided to do this together because it's the app we wanted for ourselves, and we think it's important that people have a place that remains dedicated to being the best place to catch up with friends and family. \\n\\nAnd that's what Retro is - a social app that feels like a joy, not a habit. It's a friends-only a photo journal where you share for yourself as much as your friends. It gently nudges you to find at least one moment each week to remember and then put it out there in a post so your friends know what you're up to. It's launching today, so it's still a very small community, but it seems to be resonating with people, especially people from the design community. One early indicator that we're on the right track is that friends we know that deeply value privacy and safety feel comfortable enough to share photos of their kids' faces and flight itineraries and wild parties - things they wouldn't feel comfortable sharing elsewhere.\\n\\nSo give it a whirl! If you've taken a photo on your iPhone in the last week, you have enough to get started. And as you use it over the course of a couple weeks, we hope it helps you appreciate moments big and small in your own life and in the lives of your friends and family.\\n\\nWe hope you love it.\", 'votesCount': 23}}, {'node': {'body': \"I've really been enjoying Retro.

I found <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jakobgreenfeld\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Jakob Greenfeld\\'s</a> book \"The Big Book of Business Idea Prompts\" super helpful with this brainstorming task, as it contains a ton of awesome prompts for brainstorming business ideas.

I also find it funny to brainstorm ideas with GPT, so I added the possibility to brainstorm with GPT. I usually find it more valuable to brainstorm without GPT, but sometimes it provides interesting perspectives I didn\\'t see before.\\n\\n✨ How BusinessIdeaPrompts Works\\n\\nIt\\'s super straightforward. BusinessIdeaPrompts generates thought-provoking prompts for brainstorming business ideas. You can take those prompts and brainstorm with them. If you want, you can feed the prompts, together with some context you can optionally provide, into GPT to get more input.\\n\\n💸 Pricing\\n\\nBusinessIdeaPrompts is free. I currently limited the amount of requests you can send to GPT to keep costs under control. If I see many people using this feature, I might implement a way for you to bring your own API key or pay for the requests.\\n\\n\\n❤️ Let me know what you think!\\n\\nI\\'d love to hear your opinions and suggestions!

So you don’t have to think about what folder to put things in, just think about what they relate to. \\n\\nInstead of files, we organize content and media as colorful objects. You can determine, what types of objects you want, and what properties and look they have! If you read a lot, just create “Books” to organize your reading notes. If you want to keep track of all your ideas, use “Idea” objects. And then simply link or embed them anywhere you need them. Think of Notion databases, but less containerized and more flexible. We call this “objective-taking”. \\n\\nAnd on top, all you do is automatically mapped to a central calendar with daily notes, which will become your daily working hub and let’s you browse your work over time.\\n\\nThe core product of Capacities is and will remain free.

There are a couple of issues with this: \\n\\n❌ It struggles to answer questions when the answers are not explicitly given in the database.\\n❌ Popular Generative API libraries have length limits, restricting the AI to a limited pool of contexts.\\n\\n🥊 To overcome these challenges, I've developed Afforai Build – a new Comprehension Model that tackles these issues head-on:\\n\\n✅ With Afforai Comprehension Model, our AI chatbot can identify groups of text related to the answer, even if it's not explicitly stated or requires extra reasoning steps. We observed a 5x increase in answer quality that other tools couldn’t even answer!\\n\\n✅ Our Comprehension Model allows the AI to combine information from different answers and filter irrelevant details. The result? An information-dense answer with a reading coverage of 100,000 words – that's 10x more than the vector embedding method!\\n\\nOur Comprehension Model is highly recommended for tasks like document comprehension, reasoning, report writing, and research.

With Netmaker, our users are doing everything from simple remote access, to connecting fleets of unmanned aerial drones and cloud-bursting k8s clusters for machine learning. 🏗️\\n\\nHow it works: You define your networks via our UI, and join machines using the netclient, which manages WireGuard connections locally. The server and client work together to determine the best way for peers to reach each other, solving for NATs, firewalls, and port availability. The result is a flexible virtual network that stays in sync whenever changes are made.\\n\\nKey Features:\\n🕸️ Mesh Networks: Peer-to-peer VPNs that mimics subnets.\\n➡️ Egress Gateway: Remotely access networks outside the VPN\\n⬅️ Client Gateway: Hook customized WireGuard configs into the network\\n↕️    Relay: Set clients as middle-men for traffic\\n🚦  ACLs: Define which machines can reach each other\\n🌐  DNS: Private DNS for your network\\n\\nThere are other solutions out there with similarities, but we’ve got some key distinctions. First off, Netmaker is super fast ⚡because it uses kernel WireGuard. There are some other WireGuard-based solutions like Tailscale, but they use userspace WireGuard, which is much slower.\\n\\nSecond, Netmaker is tailored for infrastructure use cases like the cloud, IoT, and Kubernetes. ☁️ Stuff like OpenVPN was built before the cloud became a go-to deployment strategy. ✅\\n\\nFinally, Netmaker is fully self-hostable. Our SaaS option makes it easy to get started, but we believe our users should still have the option to fully own their infrastructure if they don’t want 3rd party servers getting involved with their data. 🎉\\n\\nWe’re always looking for ways to do things better.

After two operations and two years of physiotherapy, I could barely walk, and doctors told me I would need a cane for the rest of my life. I refused to accept this diagnosis! Instead of training with weights in one-dimensional motions, I used my engineering background in mechanics to develop the most efficient way to activate muscle fibers: instability and asymmetry. I turned to exercises with fitballs, which are inherently unstable. This forced my brain to coordinate several parts of my body and rapidly activate muscle fibers. Within six months of daily 10-minute fitball exercises, my leg was fully restored in terms of both strength and flexibility. Witnessing these mind-blowing results, I decided to apply the same logic to the entire body, thus creating Logic Workout.\\n\\nThe app: all the thinking and planning are taken care of. Every day, experience a tailored workout based on your fitness level and goal. Each workout consists of a combination of four exercises. Levels range from Entry to Ultimate.

It would be beneficial for you to consider hiring a graphic designer, especially for your marketing materials. I couldn't help but notice that the slides in the PH post could use some work. The font choice feels a bit cheap, the gradients appear random, and the buttons give off a nostalgic vibe of the early 2000s.

Whether you need to look up how to get to point X, answer work mail, have a conference call, mobile data is essential to our lives today. That's why we created Unisim. We wanted to make an easy-to-use product that requires little to none effort to use during travels. Install our eSIM once and you are good to go. Let me go over our benefits to tell you why we believe that Unisim is a universal solution for going abroad:\\n\\n- Pay as You Go: Once you top up Unisim, you get charged only for used mobile data, per each KB. It means that your balance will never expire on its own, it can only be used by you.\\n\\n- Global Coverage: Unisim covers 148 countries with high-speed mobile data at the moment of writing this statement. We work on adding new countries. Hopefully, the number will increase soon.\\n\\n- Easy to use: All you need to do is top up your balance and turn on Unisim. First connection usually takes up to 3 minutes, meaning that you are online and answering messages before the plane completely stops after landing.\\n\\n- Completely remote: There is no need to wait in lines in SIM stores at the airport and no need for communication in foreign languages fearing that everyone will try to fool you. You are all set even before arrival.\\n\\nGive Unisim a shot, we care about our product and want to make it even better!

I didn\\'t know much about video editing and money was tight. It was tough. I spent a month trying to figure it out. During this time, I realized others probably have the same struggle, and I wanted to help.\\n\\n🌟 How Clippulse Works\\nWith Clippulse, making a promotional video is straightforward and simple. It\\'s a tool where you get to put together different scenes, add animated parts to them, and set up how they transition. What\\'s cool is, if you have a music track, you can easily set your scenes to change with the beat of the music. It\\'s about making a promo video your way, without needing to be a video editing expert.\\n\\n🔥 Main Features\\nClippulse lets you make your own promo videos, broken down into parts we call \\'scenes\\'. You get to choose how long each scene lasts, the order they\\'re in, and how they look - like changing the text styles or colors. You can also set the video quality to match where you plan to share it. Every item you add to a scene can be customized – its size, position, how it lines up with other items, its color, and more. And if you have a music track, you can make the scene changes match the beat by just hitting \\'Sync\\'.\\n\\n💰 Pricing\\nCreating an account on Clippulse is free! Feel free to design and play around with your video without any charges. It operates on a credit-based system where you only pay $11 per video when you\\'re satisfied with your creation and ready to export.\\n\\n🚀 Launch day special\\nTo celebrate our Product Hunt launch, use the code MEOW15 at checkout for a discount on any order placed before July 12, 2023.\\n\\n💜 Let me know what you think!\\nYour feedback, suggestions, and questions are super valuable to me.
