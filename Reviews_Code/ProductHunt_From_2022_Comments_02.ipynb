Not a Martin Luther King \"I have a dream\" dream, but a regular ol\\' snoozing dream, in which I built a website called \"Chore Pig\". When I woke in the middle of the night, I couldn\\'t quite remember what the app was supposed to do, but I frantically pulled up a domain search engine, and ended up the proud owner of <a href=\"https://chorepig.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://chorepig.com</a>.\\n\\nI have a complicated relationship with to-do lists. Though I undoubtedly am better at juggling tasks and remembering what needs doing when I use a list, I also find that the design of many apps goads me into focusing on the process of checking items off the list rather than the substance of the list itself. Is this a priority 3 or a priority 4 task? What other task can I check off to hit my daily streak? This list is so messy - do I need more tags, more sections, more projects??\\n\\nI\\'m not sure how widespread these feelings are, but given that one of the leading to-do apps has a \"Vacation mode\" which will retain your daily streak while you\\'re away, I don\\'t think I\\'m the only one. I want an app that helps me remember what to do, not one that pushes me into becoming a pig. A real chore pig.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s already tons of apps out there that would work for me. So why build a new one? My phone\\'s notes app would work, but syncing across devices is a bit tricky. There\\'s about 4,213 Google task apps, but you never know if the one you choose is going to be shut down tomorrow. For a while I even sent myself emails with tasks, but... blech!\\n\\nErgo, Chore Pig. So what does it do?\\n\\nChore Pig is a website, but the data is stored locally on your device. No sign-up is required, just go to the site and start adding tasks to the hog log.\\n\\nChore Pig is also a Progressive Web App (PWA), making it installable on your phone or tablet for easy access. Navigate to the website using Chrome on Android or Safari on iOS, and within too long you should get a prompt to install Chore Pig as an application.\\n\\nChore Pig is offline-first, meaning that you can keep on adding and completing tasks, even when your network is spotty, or non-existent.\\n\\nIf you want to take your porcine commitment to the next level, you can sign up for an account for a one-time fee of $10. Sign in to the account on any device that you want to sync tasks between, and Chore Pig will automatically back up your tasks whenever you have an internet connection.\\n\\nBy creating an account, you\\'d also be giving me $10, which makes you just bully in my book. In turn, I will funnel around $5 of that straight to some hogs. And other animals, too ‚Äì I will donate 50% of the profits from Chore Pig to The Humane League.

Maik here, excited to launch for the first time on Product Hunt! üöÄ\\n\\nI'm not here to just pitch a project; I'm here to share my story and invite you along for the ride.\\n\\nWhen I was a teenager, I discovered a new world: the internet. I fell in love with a game called Runescape, where I could complete quests, meet people, and build up my in-game skills - I even maxed out many of them üòÑ. One skill that particularly caught my attention was the construction skill. It let me create a virtual home and invite friends over, which was really cool.\\n\\nüïπÔ∏è The internet became my second home, a place where I felt safer than in the real world. It's where I learned English and made friends from all over the globe; it was my first close experience with some form of a metaverse. If you've read the book or watched the movie Ready-Player-One, then you might relate to what I am talking about. If not, you should definitely do it! \\n\\nThis virtual life sparked an interest in me for digital design and architecture, so much so that I ended up getting a degree in architecture, and I now work as a product designer for a web3 startup.\\n\\nLast year, I wanted to do more than just dream about the metaverse. I wanted to build on it, to be part of the future. But when I started to research, I hit a wall.\\n\\n‚ùìThere wasn't a lot of info out there, and the existing communities were pretty hard to find. Plus, no one was (or is) really talking about metaverse designers.\\n\\nüè† Despite these obstacles, I managed to launch a metaverse project on Spatial and Decentraland. As an architect and a gamer, this experience was so much fun! It reminded me of my teenage years when I did things purely for the joy of it.\\n\\nüåê Fast forward to 2023, and I still couldn't find a platform that was mainly focused on metaverse creators. So, over a weekend, just for fun, I decided to create one myself.\\n\\nI call it metahub, a combination of 'metaverse' and 'hub'. I know it's not the most original name, but it gets the job done, and 'meta' was already taken, heh.\\n\\nüí° The idea is simple: To help metaverse designers get noticed and help others learn how to design for the metaverse.\\n\\nBeing a metaverse designer isn't just about building houses in a decentralized virtual world. It's far broader than that! You could be a Roblox designer, a fashion designer, a designer of vTuber avatars, a VR artist building digital experiences - the list goes on!\\n\\nSome people write off the metaverse as a trend that's already passed, but I see it as the next step for the internet. \\nMy hope is that Metahub can help discover new talent and even assist many in becoming a part of this emerging and exciting field.\\n\\n‚û°Ô∏è So if you're curious or want to get involved with the metaverse community, all you have to do is visit the site and click 'Join'! or DM me, that also works :) .\\n\\nI can't wait to meet the amazing metaverse designers out there, and those yet to come!\\n\\n- Maik\", 'votesCount': 2}}, {'node': {'body': 'Hello @maikwithm  congrats on launching such a cool product.

With WizeBot, you can provide instant support, reduce support ticket volumes, and ensure consistent and accurate responses.\\n\\nüíº How WizeBot Works\\nWizeBot utilizes AI to understand and respond to customer queries intelligently. It can assimilate content from uploaded documents, such as PDFs, to provide comprehensive and accurate answers. You can also customize WizeBot\\'s appearance, greeting message, and fallback responses to align with your brand.\\n\\nüí° Key Features\\nWith WizeBot, you can:\\n* Create a chatbot tailored to your business needs\\n* Upload documents to your bot‚Äôs knowledge base\\n* Customize the chatbot\\'s appearance and responses\\n* Integrate WizeBot into your website or knowledge base easily\\n* Monitor and improve WizeBot\\'s performance through analytics\\n\\nüí∞ Pricing\\nTo get started, WizeBot offers a free plan that provides access to essential features.

We think that customer trust is essential to any business, hence if our systems are unsure of a correct response, it won\\'t attempt to \"hallucinate\" information. This is in contrast to many other services, which will try to extrapolate the right answer, even if it isn\\'t true. However, we still need to acknowledge that not every AI system is perfect, and we are constantly working towards this issue.\\n\\nSecondly, we provide customers the ability to send business\\'s a message if the chatbot is unsure. This way, WizeBot can fully replace a traditional help desk system. For questions WizeBot can answer, WizeBot will happily answer. For the questions WizeBot can not answer, the user will be prompted to send a message to the bot owner.\\n\\nThirdly, we allow the ability to password protect your chatbot. This way, you can limit a chatbot to internal or specific customer use. For enterprise solutions such as SSO, feel free to contact us.\\n\\nWe think WizeBot can be used in more than just customer service. For example, firms can deliver projects with an attached chatbot, providing clients with better service. Onboarding guides can be switched over to onboarding chat bots to help new users. And so many more!\\n\\nOnce again, we would love to help any new users onboard to WizeBot. Send us an email at: (<a href=\"mailto:support@wizebot.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">support@wizebot.io</a>) or reach out on other social medias.

We noticed an increasing demand for tools that can either replace or simplify the work of developers - low-code/no-code technologies. With predictions indicating that by 2030, over 60% of mobile and web applications will be built using these technologies, we decided to step in. Codejet fully automates the conversion of design into functioning code, saving around 60% of the front-end developers\\' time.\\n\\nImagine this - in the fourth quarter of 2022, there were 507,690 UI designers worldwide and about 17.2 million front-end developers who convert these designs into functional code. Each element of an application is manually processed. With Codejet, we can save up to 60% of the time that a programmer would spend on this kind of work. That\\'s a significant saving for a company creating or outsourcing an application!\\n\\nOur primary customers are software agencies employing 2-10 front-end developers and freelancers. We aim to solve their pain points such as:\\nüëâ Project costs rising due to improperly implemented frontend by developers.\\nüëâ Multiple front-end corrections leading to logic errors.\\nüëâ Time-consuming processes during front-end implementation, such as forms.\\nüëâ Late changes to the UI project, which can be costly and error-prone.\\n\\nCodejet is a dev tool, not just a code converter for landing pages. The elements we generate can be edited and reused elsewhere. \\n\\nIf you have your own Figma, it will require a few tweaks, but they won\\'t take more than a few hours - here are the instructions.

The apps that have traditionally served this purpose well have taken a hard pivot toward entertainment content created by people you don't know, and even though this content is entertaining, it also crowds out the other content that friends share with each other. So now we're left sorting through a ton of message threads to see what's going on with friends, or most commonly, we just don't get that update at all. That's a superpower lost.\\n\\n@ryanolsonk and I first worked together on the project that became Instagram Stories, where we fell in love with this use case of opening a window into friends' lives. We were recently joined by @petermcottle and @seanleach_, who also share IG DNA and a love for craft and simplicity. Even though consumer social is insanely hard, we decided to do this together because it's the app we wanted for ourselves, and we think it's important that people have a place that remains dedicated to being the best place to catch up with friends and family. \\n\\nAnd that's what Retro is - a social app that feels like a joy, not a habit. It's a friends-only a photo journal where you share for yourself as much as your friends. It gently nudges you to find at least one moment each week to remember and then put it out there in a post so your friends know what you're up to. It's launching today, so it's still a very small community, but it seems to be resonating with people, especially people from the design community. One early indicator that we're on the right track is that friends we know that deeply value privacy and safety feel comfortable enough to share photos of their kids' faces and flight itineraries and wild parties - things they wouldn't feel comfortable sharing elsewhere.\\n\\nSo give it a whirl! If you've taken a photo on your iPhone in the last week, you have enough to get started. And as you use it over the course of a couple weeks, we hope it helps you appreciate moments big and small in your own life and in the lives of your friends and family.\\n\\nWe hope you love it.\", 'votesCount': 23}}, {'node': {'body': \"I've really been enjoying Retro.

If you want, you can feed the prompts, together with some context you can optionally provide, into GPT to get more input.\\n\\nüí∏ Pricing\\n\\nBusinessIdeaPrompts is free.

You can focus on your breathing, listen to soothing music, and enjoy the beautiful scenery. And you can experience the smooth change of day and night, which makes the game even more beautiful. You can watch the sunrise and sunset, the stars and the moon, and the different colors of the sky and the water.\\n\\nThe player can also catch bottles to learn the history of the world or read a fun message from a random player. The player can also send such messages themselves. This allows you to dive more into the world of the game and relax.\\n\\nWe tried to make the game itself as meditative as possible, where the player watches the boat, can fish with a swipe üêü, learn and immerse themselves in the history of the world.\\n\\nWe are now studying user reactions and how well the game helps players relax. And in the future we want to add more meditation modes and maybe integrate them more with the gameplay.

Powered by GPT-4, it works much like the workflow of a real human editor: It first understands the entire video, segments it into chapters, then selects the juiciest parts and rearranges them into clips with viral potential.\\n\\nWe've machine-learned all the sweetest tricks of short video editing at every turn by collaborating with top-notch video editors. And here are several AI features that are unique to us: \\n\\n‚≠êÔ∏è AI curation:&nbsp;Accurately finds important topics or highlights in your footage to create desired shorts\\n‚≠êÔ∏è Auto reframe: Intelligently identifies moving subjects to ensure accuracy frame by frame\\n‚≠êÔ∏è AI virality score: Automatically generates a score to show the virality potential of each short clip\\n‚≠êÔ∏è AI co-pilot: You can select a specific timeframe to clip, or look for specific parts to clip based on keywords\\n‚≠êÔ∏è AI emoji and keyword highlighter: Automatically highlights the most valuable keywords and adds relevant emojis\\n\\nWe created Opus Clip with the mission to&nbsp;democratize video content creation, making it accessible to anyone with a story to tell or a passion to share‚Äînot just those with expertise in video editing. We know that a minute spent on editing means a minute closer to the burnout, so we created the Opus Clip copilot to free your creativity and authenticity.\\n\\nSince we launched the private beta in early April, we already have over 300,000 creators, agencies, marketers, podcasters, skilled workers, NPOs, media, etc. to create and grow fasterüíú Tens of thousands of creators, big or small, have seen double-digit growth for their social media channelsü•≥\\n\\nAs we are a small team and we want to ensure everyone has a smooth experience using Opus Clip, our product is currently limited to certain countries and regions. We are working hard to expand our server, and we will make the product available to more countries in the near future.\\n\\nThis is just our first step in integrating AI into creative video creation.

The server and client work together to determine the best way for peers to reach each other, solving for NATs, firewalls, and port availability. The result is a flexible virtual network that stays in sync whenever changes are made.\\n\\nKey Features:\\nüï∏Ô∏è Mesh Networks: Peer-to-peer VPNs that mimics subnets.\\n‚û°Ô∏è Egress Gateway: Remotely access networks outside the VPN\\n‚¨ÖÔ∏è Client Gateway: Hook customized WireGuard configs into the network\\n‚ÜïÔ∏è    Relay: Set clients as middle-men for traffic\\nüö¶  ACLs: Define which machines can reach each other\\nüåê  DNS: Private DNS for your network\\n\\nThere are other solutions out there with similarities, but we‚Äôve got some key distinctions. First off, Netmaker is super fast ‚ö°because it uses kernel WireGuard. There are some other WireGuard-based solutions like Tailscale, but they use userspace WireGuard, which is much slower.\\n\\nSecond, Netmaker is tailored for infrastructure use cases like the cloud, IoT, and Kubernetes. ‚òÅÔ∏è Stuff like OpenVPN was built before the cloud became a go-to deployment strategy. ‚úÖ\\n\\nFinally, Netmaker is fully self-hostable.

Founder of Teknikforce and a long-time bootstrappeed entrepreneur. I started coding at the age of 17 and launched my first product when I was 18 (It was called HindiPad and was a commercial success).\\n\\nüí•About AI Collective\\nAI Collective is my latest release and my target to make it easier to access AI. This product gives one-app access to OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT and many other AI models from several organizations.\\n\\nüí•Our USP\\nMy target is to give people a single front-end to all of AI. You can just integrate your API key and use multiple AIs from one place.\\n\\nThe best thing about this is,  you can use the output from one AI as an input to another. You can also use multiple AIs to compare which one gives you the best results without going to multiple websites.\\n\\nPlus it has many extra features like ready-made prompts, personas, document uploading and other features.\\n\\nThis product is actively under development and we have released a new version almost every week since it was created. Next on our roadmap is Plugins.\\n\\nWe are also scouting and integrating with multiple AIs to give our users the maximum number of options.\\n\\nüí•Check it out please!\\nYou can see the product website on <a href=\"https://getaicollective.in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://getaicollective.in</a>\\n\\nI first introduced it as a downloadable script that you can install on your own hosting but later pivoted to SAAS because my customers asked for it. Right now it\\'s available as both but we are going SAAS only shortly.\\n\\nüí•Competition\\nThere are similar alternatives to this product in the market, but in AI Collective we are going to differentiate with\\n\\n- Active and continuous development\\n- Multiple AI features\\n\\nSo if you are looking to do more with AI please give AI Collective a look and see what we\\'ve done. \\n\\nThere\\'s a free version with limited functionalities that you can try right away.\\n\\nüí•Discount for Product Hunters!\\nI also have a discount coupon \"ZjjvtK4r9Xfq\" which will give you $25 off on the listed price.\\n\\nIf you have questions, I have 24 x 6 live chat support and in case any technical help is required, we are happy to help  you on Skype chat.\\n\\nüí•Customer Support\\nTeknikforce, my company is rated nearly 5 stars on Google Business from our customers and all our products are top rated on multiple platforms.

After two operations and two years of physiotherapy, I could barely walk, and doctors told me I would need a cane for the rest of my life. I refused to accept this diagnosis! Instead of training with weights in one-dimensional motions, I used my engineering background in mechanics to develop the most efficient way to activate muscle fibers: instability and asymmetry. I turned to exercises with fitballs, which are inherently unstable. This forced my brain to coordinate several parts of my body and rapidly activate muscle fibers. Within six months of daily 10-minute fitball exercises, my leg was fully restored in terms of both strength and flexibility. Witnessing these mind-blowing results, I decided to apply the same logic to the entire body, thus creating Logic Workout.\\n\\nThe app: all the thinking and planning are taken care of. Every day, experience a tailored workout based on your fitness level and goal. Each workout consists of a combination of four exercises. Levels range from Entry to Ultimate.

It\\'s a bit more bare-bones, missing a few special integrations like `--generate-image` or the ability to add to Hero Spaces, but it\\'s there for all you DIY folks.\\n\\nSpeaking of Hero Spaces, they\\'re not just some dull old storage room. Think of them more like your personal studio, where you can tinker with AI-text responses, neatly tuck your creations into shareable corners, and build a library full of prompts just waiting to be used.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s talk about the money stuff. HeroML has a free version that gives you 20 image generations each month. But if you\\'re feeling extra creative, we have a $7.99 monthly plan that lets you generate up to 1000 images.\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s the app demo\\'d in the tutorial video! <a href=\"https://hero.page/app/satyriverse-ai-mystic-imaging-unleash-your-mythical-creativity/04yGcqTAL0fszovS2xA9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://hero.page/app/satyrivers...</a>\\n\\nAt Hero, we\\'re all about having fun while we create, share, and discover. With HeroML, we\\'re inviting you to join the party and add some AI sparkle to it all. Jump in, and let\\'s shape the future of AI workflow applications together! üåç\\n\\nRemember, we love hearing from you. Your feedback helps us make Hero even better.

The issue was with SSL redirects.\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\n<a href=\"http://domain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://domain.com</a> ‚Üí <a href=\"http://domain.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://domain.io</a> [worked]\\n<a href=\"http://domain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://domain.com</a> ‚Üí <a href=\"https://domain.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://domain.io</a> [worked]\\n<a href=\"https://domain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://domain.com</a> ‚Üí <a href=\"https://domain.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://domain.io</a> [didn\\'t work]\\n\\nIt kept returning the dreaded SSL not secure error.\\n\\nEventually giving up trying to do this with just the DNS, I wrote a Netlify dummy website and created a redirect built into the configuration, and got SSL working.\\n\\nI found out that Google Domains does SSL domain forwarding for free when your domain is registered with them and there are other DNS services like DNSimple that charge a fee for SSL redirection.

Today is a big day for me as it\\'s the first time I‚Äôm launching a product on Product Hunt.

I didn\\'t know much about video editing and money was tight. It was tough. I spent a month trying to figure it out. During this time, I realized others probably have the same struggle, and I wanted to help.\\n\\nüåü How Clippulse Works\\nWith Clippulse, making a promotional video is straightforward and simple. It\\'s a tool where you get to put together different scenes, add animated parts to them, and set up how they transition. What\\'s cool is, if you have a music track, you can easily set your scenes to change with the beat of the music. It\\'s about making a promo video your way, without needing to be a video editing expert.\\n\\nüî• Main Features\\nClippulse lets you make your own promo videos, broken down into parts we call \\'scenes\\'. You get to choose how long each scene lasts, the order they\\'re in, and how they look - like changing the text styles or colors. You can also set the video quality to match where you plan to share it. Every item you add to a scene can be customized ‚Äì its size, position, how it lines up with other items, its color, and more. And if you have a music track, you can make the scene changes match the beat by just hitting \\'Sync\\'.\\n\\nüí∞ Pricing\\nCreating an account on Clippulse is free! Feel free to design and play around with your video without any charges. It operates on a credit-based system where you only pay $11 per video when you\\'re satisfied with your creation and ready to export.\\n\\nüöÄ Launch day special\\nTo celebrate our Product Hunt launch, use the code MEOW15 at checkout for a discount on any order placed before July 12, 2023.\\n\\nüíú Let me know what you think!\\nYour feedback, suggestions, and questions are super valuable to me.
